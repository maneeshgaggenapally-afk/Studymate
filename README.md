ðŸ§  StudyMate Pro: Advanced PDF Q&A
StudyMate Pro is an intelligent web application built with Streamlit and Google Gemini that allows you to "chat" with your PDF documents. Upload your study materials, research papers, or any PDF file, and get accurate, context-aware answers backed by source citations.

ðŸš€ About The Project
This project is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to make studying and research more efficient. Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages, you can ask questions in natural language and receive synthesized answers directly from your documents.

âœ¨ Key Features
Multiple PDF Uploads: Upload and process several PDF documents at once to create a comprehensive knowledge base.

AI-Powered Q&A: Leverages Google's Gemini model to understand your questions and generate coherent, human-like answers.

Precise Source Citations: Every answer is supported by the exact source passages from your documents, including the filename and page number.

Secure API Key Handling: Uses Streamlit's secrets management to keep your Google Gemini API key safe and private.

Adjustable Context: Fine-tune the context chunk size and the number of source passages used for generating answers.
